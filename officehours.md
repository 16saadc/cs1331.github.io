## Professor's Office Hours

* Lillethun: Wednesdays 12:30-2:00 in Klaus 2205
* Simpkins: Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays 09:00-10:00 in CoC 133 or CoC 107. Any time my office door is open, feel free to walk in. Email me if you need to see me, even during office hours since I won't necessarily be in my office or the TA lab if I'm not expecting anyone.
